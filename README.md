Skiing Dynamics
==============

Implementation of a particle-based model to simulates the trajectories of skiers. Skiers are modeled as particles subjected to physical and social forces, which define their riding behavior during the descents on ski slopes. Physical forces determine the acceleration of skiers. Social forces are used to individuate the skiers desired direction, namely the direction in which a skier is inclined to travel, that is used to decide whether skiers need to adjust their direction performing a turn. The implementation is realized in C++ using the GRASS GIS C-API.
